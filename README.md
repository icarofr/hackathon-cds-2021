# Hackathon CDS 2021

A project built in 24h for CDS Groupe's hackathon where I was my group's sole developer.

The project is a way of filtering eco-friendly hotels. You can watch the whole presentation [here (warning: French)](https://github.com/icarofr/hackathon-cds-2021/blob/main/presentation.pdf) and view the site deployed [here.](https://hackathon-cds-2021.vercel.app/)

PS. It's a hackathon, bad code is expected.
